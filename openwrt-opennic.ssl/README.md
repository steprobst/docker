# opennic bind with openwrt
- little Docker Con based on openwrt (from Scratch) with bind (DNS, DoH and DoT with lets encrypt cert)
  - DNS TXT Update via API from Hetzner - you need a token for Hetzner API -> you can change this for another provider
  - acme.sh make the lets encrypt cert 
- the srvzone script comes from opennic wiki
